\begin{abstract}
Hamiltonian of generalized harmonic general relativity formulation is derived. The system is further extended to obtain a general covariant format of Hamiltonian and action. Explicitly covariant Hamilton's equations are derived based on the extended Hamiltonian. The result is a system of partial differential equations with first order time and first order space derivatives for the spatial metric, lapse function, shift vector, gauge source vector and their conjugate momenta. This partial differential equations system is further proved to be symmetric hyperbolic.
